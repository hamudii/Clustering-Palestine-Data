2389,AryehLevine1,@MarkRuffalo Mark. maybe you mean well. but peace cannot exist while Hamas is still at large. Israel spent the past 17 years defending its innocent civilians from Hamas. on October 7th we all saw the full extent of terror. Palestine needs to be free from Hamas first. then we can have peace.,Tue Oct 24 14:59:26 +0000 2023,https://twitter.com/AryehLevine1/status/1716831772032589861

2396,_thenasim_,@amantinband Israel did not exists back then. If people wants their land back and attack the oppressor. do you call it terrorism? Imagine Isarel as Palestine and Palestine as Isarel. How would you feel? Palestine just want their land back and stop Israeli oppressions. https://t.co/uFLy35707M,Tue Oct 24 14:59:23 +0000 2023,https://twitter.com/_thenasim_/status/1716831759512527344

2437,eitansgarden,Queers for Palestine rally at @nyuniversity - “Reproductive Justice means Free Palestine”  In Palestine. any abortion is strictly outlawed. often forcing women to end their own pregnancies in sometimes fatal ways.

2456,UmakemeLaughHa,@justin_hart If you cannot condemn both side for what is happening right now. you are the problem. Hamas i a terrorist group and the Palestine's are harboring or helping them.
